...  yet another tetris game with a bunch of javascript tech (react, mobx, bootstrap, ES6)

Playable on andraskovacs.github.io/tetris

Clone or download, then `npm install`, then `npm start` starts a dev server on http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/.

`npm run build` builds the `index.js` bundle, which can be deployed alongside `index.html` and `bootstrap.min.css`.
